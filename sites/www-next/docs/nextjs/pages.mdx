In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Add a page by creating a new `about.jsx` file under `pages`.

```jsx title=pages/about.jsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <section py="12|16" mx="auto">
      <div
        variant="container"
        sx={{
          bg: "muted",
        }}
      >
        <h1 variant="heading.h1">The React Framework for Production</h1>
        <p fontSize="2xl" mt="4">
          Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features
          you need for production
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```
